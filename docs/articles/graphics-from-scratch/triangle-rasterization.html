    This article is part of
    <a class="link-no-color" href="../../index.html">Graphics From Scratch</a>,
    a series of articles on computer graphics. Start from the beginning if you
    want to know what's going on.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  In
  <a href="triangle-barycentric-coordinates.html" title="Triangle: Inside or Outside?">the previous article</a>,
  we saw how we can determine if a point is inside a triangle, and we're now
  ready to render our triangle. The process of selecting pixels that fall inside
  a triangle is what we call rasterization, which is what every game and
  graphics program uses to render images. Said pixels are sometimes called
  fragments, and you'll see these terms being used interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
  We'll add this nested loop at the bottom of the code section:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        # pixel center point
        p = Vec2(...)

        # see if p falls inside the triangle
        bary: Vec3 = cart_to_bary(p, v0, v1, v2)
        is_inside: bool = not bary_is_outside(bary)

        # pick colors for the background and the triangle
        COL_BG = Color(.1, .1, .1)
        COL_TRI = Color(.26, .62, .88)

        # determine the final color
        col: Color = COL_TRI if is_inside else COL_BG

        # update the buffer
        idx = ...
        buf[idx] = col</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Pixel Center</h2>
<p>
  Next, we need to fill the omitted parts in the code (<code>...</code>).
  Starting from the top, we need to calculate the current pixel's center
  coordinates. As discussed previously, the center coordinates are offset by 0.5
  units from the integer coordinates of the pixel:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        # pixel center point
        p = Vec2(x + .5, y + .5)

    ...  </code></pre>
</p>


<h2>Indices and Ordering</h2>
<p>
  Now, <code>buf</code> is a one-dimensional array, but we're working with a 2D
  grid of pixels, so how do we convert our integer X and Y coordinates to a 1D
  coordinate?
  We <em>could</em> have used a 2D array from the start, but learning how things
  are laid out in memory (RAM or VRAM) helps us better understand the decisions
  we make. After all, memory addresses are 1D indices. Consider the following
  5x3 grid.
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/5x3grid.png" alt="a 5 by 3 grid" title="a 5 by 3 grid"
  style="width: 32rem;" />

<p>
  How would you personally order the cells in a 1D sequence? Would you do it
  like this?
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/5x3grid-order1.png"
  alt="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells"
  title="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells" style="width: 32rem;" />

<p>
  Or, this?
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/5x3grid-order2.png"
  alt="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells"
  title="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells" style="width: 32rem;" />

<p>
  Yeah, I don't think so. We need to pick an order we can easily derive a
  formula for. A formula that can turn our X and Y to a 1D index, and vice
  versa. Here's one such ordering:
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/5x3grid-order3.png"
  alt="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells"
  title="a 5 by 3 grid with a path showing the order of the cells" style="width: 32rem;" />

<p>
  Let's make a table for X and Y and the index to find the relation between
  them. Keep in mind the width and height which are 5 and 3 respectively.
</p>

<div class="overflow-auto">
  <table class="striped" style="display: inline-block;">

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">12</th>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>3</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">14</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  Take a look at X as the index goes up: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
</p>
<p>
  It's a repeating pattern. It looks a lot like taking the remainder in an
  integer division. In fact, it <em>is</em> the remainder of an integer
  division: it's <code>index % 5</code>. More generally, it's
  <code>index % WIDTH</code>. So, now you know how to calculate X based on the
  1D index and the width of the image.
</p>
<p>
  Let's do the same with Y. The values from top to bottom are five 0s, five 1s,
  and five 2s. It seems like Y is being divided by some other integer, because
  it's increasing in a slow rate in a linear fashion. Turns out, Y is equal to
  <code>index // 5</code>, which, in general, is <code>index // WIDTH</code>.
  The <code>//</code> symbol is for integer division where the result is
  floored.
</p>
<p>
  We now know how to convert a 1D index to X and Y integer coordinates, but how
  do we do the inverse? How do we go from X and Y to the 1D index? One thing you
  can notice is that every time X goes up by 1, or resets back to 0 after
  reaching <code>WIDTH</code>, the index also goes up by one. Another thing is
  that the indices of the cells in the first row range from 0 to 4, while the
  second row has indices from 5 to 9, and the third row goes from 10 to 14,
  which is a total of 15 indices, because we have 15 cells. The index is almost
  equal to X, except it increases by 5, or <code>WIDTH</code>, every time we go
  to the next row. The index is equal to <code>x + (y * WIDTH)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Let's create functions for these conversions. We'll add them at the end of the
  functions section.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">... (other functions)


def idx_to_icoord(idx: int, width: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    return (idx % width, idx // width)


def icoord_to_idx(x: int, y: int, width: int) -> int:
    return x + (y * width)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  We can now update the code that modifies the buffer.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        ...

        # update the buffer
        idx = icoord_to_idx(x, y, WIDTH)
        buf[idx] = col</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Because of the way processors work, jumping around to random places in memory
  is much slower than iterating it linearly, one block after another. It's
  faster to access the elements of an array ordered by the index than to access
  them in a random and/or unpredictable pattern. This explains why the outer
  <em>for loop</em> goes through the height of the image while the inner loop
  iterates through the width of the image. This way, <code>idx</code> is
  incremented by 1 every time. If it were the other way around, it would be
  incremented by <code>WIDTH</code> in every iteration, which would slow us down
  by a lot.
</p>

<h2>Exporting</h2>
<p>
  Since we're not using a graphics API, or a library that uses a graphics API,
  we can't really display our image on the screen. It would suck if we couldn't
  see what we're rendering. That's where the fun is, after all. To work around
  this, we can export our image to a PNG file and hand off the task of
  displaying the image to an image viewer program, like the one that comes
  default with your operating system. There are several Python libraries for
  working with image files, but the one we'll use is
  <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">Pillow</a>. You can
  find the installation instructions
  <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/basic-installation.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
  We'll start by importing the <code>Image</code> class from the library. We'll
  put all import statements at the top of the script.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from PIL import Image</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Back at the very bottom, we'll add this piece of code to export our image to
  a PNG file.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># export to PNG
img: Image = Image.new('RGB', (WIDTH, HEIGHT))
img.putdata(buf_rgb8)
img.save(PNG_SAVE_PATH, 'PNG')</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a constant for the PNG save path in the constants section. You can
  use any other path you want.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">PNG_SAVE_PATH: str = './cpu-triangle.png'</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  What the <code>Image.putdata()</code> function expects from us is an array of
  <code>tuple[int, int, int]</code>, but <code>buf</code> is an array of
  <code>Color</code> objects, so we'll make a new buffer with the expected
  format and copy the data from <code>buf</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># RGB8 buffer
buf_rgb8: list[tuple[int, int, int]] = []
for i in range(N_PIXELS):
    col: Color = buf[i]
    buf_rgb8.append(...)

# export to PNG
...</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  So, how do we convert a <code>Color</code> to a tuple of integers? We could
  just convert the <code>float</code> values from <code>Color</code> to
  integers, but that wouldn't really work, because values like 0.5 would be
  truncated down to 0. What Pillow expects is an integer in the [0, 255] range.
  Said range comes from the fact that most everyday image files usually use
  8-bit integers to store their values, and an 8-bit integer has 2 to the power
  of 8 possible values: 256, which is exactly the number of integers we have
  from 0 to 255. This is also why we named the new buffer <code>buf_rgb8</code>.
  All we need to do now is to multiply our float values by 255 and convert them
  to integers.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># RGB8 buffer
buf_rgb8: list[tuple[int, int, int]] = []
for i in range(N_PIXELS):
    col: Color = buf[i]
    buf_rgb8.append((
        int(col.r * 255),
        int(col.g * 255),
        int(col.b * 255)
    ))</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
<p>
  Let's open the exported file and see what it looks like.
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/cpu-triangle-flipped.png" alt="an upside down triangle"
  title="an upside down triangle" style="width: 28rem;" />

<p>
  Yay! We got a triangle... except it's kinda upside down. This is a typical
  mistake you'll run into when moving image data between different libraries
  and devices. In some libraries, including Pillow, the Y coordinate starts from
  the top and goes down, which is opposite to what we have. Thankfully, there's
  a simple fix for this: we flip Y when calculating the 1D index. Back in the
  nested loops where we render our triangle, we'll modify the code that writes
  to the buffer.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        ...

        # update the buffer
        idx = icoord_to_idx(x, HEIGHT - y - 1, WIDTH)
        buf[idx] = col</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  If we run the script again, we get this image:
</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/articles/cpu-triangle.png" alt="a triangle" title="a triangle"
  style="width: 28rem;" />

<p>
  Congrats! You now know how to manually render a triangle from scratch without
  ever using a graphics library. This seemingly insignificant piece of knowledge
  is, in reality, highly valuable, and will greatly help us when we want to work
  with an actual graphics API.
</p>

<p>
  In the next article, we'll modify our code to be able to render multiple
  triangles with different colors.
