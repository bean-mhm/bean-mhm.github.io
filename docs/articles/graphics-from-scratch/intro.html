  Computer graphics is a field that combines math, physics, programming, and art
  to create breathtaking scenery and immersive experiences. Whether you're a
  regular gamer with little to no programming knowledge, or a professional, or
  anything in between, whether you're just learning it or working on a real
  project, graphics programming is always rewarding because you get to visually
  see the changes your code makes. You get to generate photorealistic images
  literally from scratch, and this is several times more fun when you actually
  know what you're doing, when you stop needing to watch tutorials constantly
  and come up with new, more efficient, algorithms yourself.
</p>

<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>
  This is a series of articles with the goal of making intuitive explanations on
  how things work under the hood. I am taking a "rediscovery" approach rather
  than a "feed in" approach. Instead of telling you what you should do to
  achieve X, we start from scratch and do things naively. We keep falling into
  problems and solving them together. This teaches you the reason <em>why we do
    it this way and not that way</em>, and <em>why this method is bad and this
    one is good</em> in a relatable way.
</p>

<h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
<p>
  While it's certainly more biased towards beginners, I'm positive those with
  different levels of understanding will learn something new as well, or gain a
  deeper intuition about some concepts.
</p>

<h2>What You Need To Know Beforehand</h2>
<p>
  If you know high school math, second-degree polynomials, basic calculus, and
  vector math, you're good. If you wanna learn vector math in a visual way, I
  highly suggest you watch

    3Blue1Brown's free video tutorial series on linear algebra.

</p>
<p>
  A tiny amount of programming skills will also help you along the way. If you
  know absolutely nothing about programming, I suggest you learn Python as it's
  really straightforward.
</p>
<p>
  If you're not familiar with some of these, I encourage you to still continue
  reading the articles, as I'll mention highly valuable sources for learning
  the necessary topics.

  In the next article, we discuss why we need a graphics card.
