      <p>
  If you've ever worked with 3D modeling software before, you should know that,
  at the most fundumental level, 3D models are made up of triangles. It's common
  knowledge in graphics that GPUs are optimized for rendering triangles, and
  it makes sense too. A triangle is the simplest type of polygons there is, it
  just has 3 vertices, and that's it. What about shaders, though? Shaders come
  after triangles. The GPU first determines which pixels fall inside the
  triangle, and runs what's called a fragment or pixel shader only for those
  pixels. We'll explore this further a few articles later.
</p>
<p>
  Get ready for a fun ride, because we'll manually render a triangle onto an
  image in Python without ever using a graphics library or a GPU!
</p>

<h2>Python?</h2>
<p>
  There's little chance you'd be unheard of
  <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. Python is a very
  popular programming language, mostly due to its simplicity and being easy to
  learn, and that's why we'll be using Python for this tiny project.
</p>
<p>
  If you're new to programming, I recommend
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/" target="_blank">W3Schools's Python tutoiral series</a>.
  Once ready,
  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">download and install Python</a>
  and an <abbr data-tooltip="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> or
  a regular text editor. I, however, humbly suggest you start with
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>,
  and install the Python extension from the extensions menu.
</p>

<h2>The Image</h2>
<p>
  Open your favorite IDE and create an empty Python script file named
  <code>cpu-triangle.py</code> or anything you like. We'll start by defining
  some constants for the width and height of our image and the total number of
  pixels which is the product of the width and height.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">WIDTH: int = 320
HEIGHT: int = 240
N_PIXELS: int = WIDTH * HEIGHT</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Then, we'll create a <code>Color</code> class that holds red, green, and blue
  intensity values. We'll put this class at the bottom, below the constants.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Color:
    r: float
    g: float
    b: float

    def __init__(self, r: float, g: float, b: float) -> None:
        self.r = r
        self.g = g
        self.b = b</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Now, we need a way to represent our image, so we'll create an array of RGB
  colors named <code>buf</code>, short for buffer. Note that we won't be using
  libraries like NumPy for multi-dimensional arrays, parallel computations,
  cleaner code, or anything else it provides. This will result in inefficient
  code that's slower to run, but it'll serve our purpose of learning with more
  insight.
</p>

<p>
  Put the following code at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># create buffer and initialize all colors to black
buf: list[Color] = []
for i in range(N_PIXELS):
    buf.append(Color(0, 0, 0))</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Vectors</h2>

<p>
  To render a triangle, we need to know its three vertices, which can be
  represented as 2D position vectors, so we'll create a class for 2D vectors,
  called <code>Vec2</code>. In graphics programming, vectors are used to
  represent positions in space, normal vectors (perpendicular to a surface),
  velocity vectors, or even RGB triplets (with <code>Vec3</code>), and many more
  things. Some programmers like to have separate classes for each of them, even
  though they have very similar implementations. This separation of classes is
  helpful to avoid bugs, and it's not necessary.
</p>

<p>
  We'll add the following code right after the <code>Color</code> class. You
  might've realized we have three sections in our code: constants, classes, and
  the actual code, which we'll call "the code section" from now on.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Vec2:
    x: float
    y: float

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  It's useful to be able to construct a vector with uniform scalar values, so
  we'll add a static method that takes a single number as its input and returns
  a <code>Vec2</code> with that number as its X and Y components.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Vec2:
    ...

    @staticmethod
    def scalar(s: float):
        return Vec2(s, s)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Every vector class needs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division. Let's add those to our vector class using
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/" target="_blank">
    Python's operator overloading
  </a> feature.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Vec2:
    ...

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vec2(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        self.x += other.x
        self.y += other.y

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Vec2(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

    def __isub__(self, other):
        self.x -= other.x
        self.y -= other.y

    def __mul__(self, other):
        return Vec2(self.x * other.x, self.y * other.y)

    def __imul__(self, other):
        self.x *= other.x
        self.y *= other.y

    def __truediv__(self, other):
        return Vec2(self.x / other.x, self.y / other.y)

    def __idiv__(self, other):
        self.x /= other.x
        self.y /= other.y</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  A negation operator flips the signs of the components, so we could have
  expressions like <code>-velocity</code> where <code>velocity</code> is a
  <code>Vec2</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Vec2:
    ...

    def __neg__(self):
        return Vec2(-self.x, -self.y)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  We'll add a lot more functions for vectors in the future, but we'll stop here
  for now.
</p>

<h2>The Triangle</h2>
<p>
  Back in the code section, after creating the buffer, we'll define the three
  vertices of our triangle, named <code>v0</code>, <code>v1</code>, and
  <code>v2</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># create buffer and initialize all colors to black
...

# triangle vertices
v0 = Vec2(64, 48)
v1 = Vec2(160, 192)
v2 = Vec2(256, 48)</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>The Rendering</h2>
<p>
  What we need to do now is to iterate through our pixels and see which ones are
  inside the triangle. This can be easily done with the help of Barycentric
  coordinates. If this is new to you, don't be scared! It's just three numbers
  representing how close a given point is to the 3 vertices of a triangle, and
  whether it is inside the triangle. In our case, that point is the center of
  the pixel. We'll discuss this further in the next article.
