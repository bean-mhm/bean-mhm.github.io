    This article is part of
    <a class="link-no-color" href="../../index.html">Graphics From Scratch</a>,
    a series of articles on computer graphics. Start from the beginning if you
    want to know what's going on.

</p>

<p>
  Have you ever wondered how your computer draws different shapes and images
  tens of times a second? Ever wondered how video games render life-like scenes
  in real-time, or how your operating system draws its windows?
</p>

<h2>Before We Start</h2>
<p>
  You're gonna see some pseudocode similar to the <code>Python</code>
  programming language, but you don't need to actually code anything or know
  how to code. We'll get to actual coding a few articles later, at which point
  I'll help you get started if you're not a programmer already.
</p>

<h2>Encoding Video Signals</h2>
<p>
  You might already know that your computer needs a GPU, graphics processing
  unit, to draw stuff onto the screen, but why's that the case? Can't we just
  use the CPU to achieve the same thing? Well, not really. Firstly, your monitor
  needs some sort of input signal to display anything. Some use HDMI ports,
  older ones might use VGA, and so on. These interfaces have different protocols
  that specify how the input signal should be encoded. So how do we send image
  data from our CPU to the display device? One idea might be to just write some
  software for the CPU implementing a video protocol and somehow connecting the
  display device to the CPU. But, as it turns out, this method is really
  inefficient because the CPU needs to spend most of its time encoding the video
  signal, and this gets worse if there's only a single core, as was common in
  the early days of computers.
</p>
<p>
  A better method is to use an entirely separate device to encode the video
  signal, such that the CPU sends raw image data to that device and continues
  to work on other stuff while the device can freely spend all of its time
  encoding the video signal and sending it to the display device. Said device is
  what we call a graphics card. Note that it doesn't necessarily need to have
  fancy rendering features and ray tracing cores. Just taking raw pixel data and
  encoding them into a video signal is enough to be called a graphics card.
</p>
<h2>Updating Millions of Pixels in Parallel</h2>
<p>
  Video signal encoding was the first reason to make graphics cards, but then,
  we quickly realized that we need a lot of parallelism to draw even simple 2D
  graphics. More specifically, we need to run the same instructions on all
  pixels at once, like a nested <em>for loop</em>. Take a look at this
  pseudocode.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Color:
    red: float
    green: float
    blue: float
    
    ...


def calculate_pixel_color(x: int, y: int) -> Color:
    ...


for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        pixels[y][x] = calculate_pixel_color(x, y)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Notice how the <code>calculate_pixel_color()</code> function only depends on
  the coordinates of the pixel it needs to shade and is independent from
  everything else. This independence is key to parallelism, and to help you
  better understand why that's the case, let's look at the following pseudocode.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def calculate_pixel_color(x: int, y: int) -> Color:
    return new Color(
      x * y,
      80,
      x + y
    )</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Suppose our image has 200 pixels in the horizontal direction and 100 in the
  vertical direction. Now, imagine we have 200*100=20,000 RGB lamps each with 3
  knobs (for the red, green, and blue intensities) in a huge field, and a
  tireless worker for every single lamp. Every worker knows the exact
  coordinates of his lamp. "Tune the red knob until it shows the product of the
  X and Y coordinates of your particular lamp.", we say to the workers. Then, we
  tell them to tune the green knob to 80, and finally we tell them to add the X
  and Y coordinates of their lamp and adjust the blue knob to the resulting
  value. Our workers are really fast and they perform these instructions in just
  a few milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
  To really pinpoint what we mean by independent instructions, we tell the
  workers to sum up all the values from their neighbors and embed the result in
  their own lamps, at once. Standing still, they look all confused. "What order
  do we start in? How can I sum up the values from my neighbors if they also
  need to sum up the values from <em>their</em> neighbors, which includes me?!
  You have lost your mind, we can't do this all at once!", they say. And they're
  in the right. What we asked them was to perform a calculation on each lamp in
  parallel where the calculation depends on the other lamps.
</p>

<p>
  All of this is to say, parallelism matters a lot, and, if we can find a way to
  <em>parallelize</em> our instructions instead of running them on each pixel
  one-by-one, we can run them a lot faster.
</p>
<p>
  Or, can we?
</p>
<h2>Shaders</h2>
<p>
  You might have already guessed that a CPU can't really perform the same
  instruction on dozens of pixels at once. Sure, modern CPUs have multiple cores
  and <abbr data-tooltip="Single Instruction, Multiple Data">SIMD</abbr>, but
  they're not quite fast enough to render realistic scenes at 60 frames per
  second. This led to the creation of shaders on graphics card, which let you
  run the same instruction on all pixels at once. Well, it's a bit more
  complicated than that, and there is still some amount of <em>serial</em> work,
  but for the sake of simplicity, you can assume all pixels are processed at
  once.
</p>
<p>
  So, is this all a GPU does? Run shaders and encode video signals? In reality,
  there are a lot more things your GPU is responsible for which we'll explore
  in future articles. For now, you can safely assume a GPU just executes
  parallel instructions on the pixels of an image and encodes it into a video
  signal.
</p>
<p>
  In the next article, we'll learn how one can make a very simple gradient
  shader from scratch.
