<p>
  Something so seemingly simple on the surface, but one that hasn't been fully
  understood yet. It's fascinating, beautiful. Some say it's just
  electromagnetic radiation. I say no, 'cause I can imagine it with my eyes
  closed.
</p>

<h2>Your Eyes Are Lying To You</h2>
<p>
  It's 2 AM. You're standing in an empty street, all quiet. You look at the
  asphalt reflecting the deep orange color emitted from the street lights. You
  look at the lights themselves, but they look yellow. Like, really bright
  yellow. You take out your phone and realize the screen has an unusual blue
  tint to it. You ignore it and keep using your phone for a couple minutes. You
  put it back in your pocket and look at what's around. Everything suddenly
  looks a lot more orange than it was before you used your phone. "Whatever",
  you say and go back to the house. You turn off the lights and go to bed. It
  gets real dark. So dark, you start seeing grainy dots. You're barely seeing
  any colors now. You fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
  It's morning. You get ready for work. You go to your car and realize you
  haven't brought your briefcase. You go back to the house. There's now a weird
  green tint all over your vision, and you can hardly see the objects in the
  house. Back in your car, you look at the asphalt again. It's glowing like
  crazy, reflecting the sun. You reach your workplace, so you park your car. You
  look at the fuel level gauge. It too has a strange green tint to it. A few
  seconds pass by. It now has a purple tint. What is going on?
</p>
<p>
  You open Instagram, and the first reel you see is some goofy optical illusion.
  You stare at it for 5 seconds. You look back at the fuel gauge. It's all
  swirly now. You're going crazy. "How does the human vision work? Why is it
  constantly changing based on what it sees?", you ask yourself, confused.
</p>

<h2>Color Models Are Just Models</h2>
<p>
  The above are just a few examples of how unpredictable the human vision is.
  You can't derive formulas for it. You can't simulate it. It's one beast of a
  system. That is to say, no color model is accurate. With full respect,
  <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>, a so-called
  perceptual color space for image processing, is not a perceptual color space.
  Nothing is. "Perceptually uniform" color spaces are <strong>not</strong>
  perceptually uniform. They do provide useful ways to closely model the vision
  of a so-called "standard observer" in a generalized manner, but your vision is
  constantly changing. A greenish white wall might look slightly more red in
  your left eye than your right eye. Spatial patterns affect colors. Patterns
  that change over time affect how you perceive colors. The human vision depends
  on a thousand different factors, and yet, all these perceptual color spaces
  work with are 3 numbers for RGB.
</p>
<p>
  Again, don't get me wrong. People who design these color spaces certainly know
  a lot more than me, and they are aware of the fact that their models can never
  be accurate. With all that, these models are still used to achieve acceptable
  results in some color-related processes.
</p>

<h2>Spectral Power Distribution</h2>
<p>
  Although we can't accurately model the human vision in a mathematical or
  algorithmic way, we can accurately model light itself, because unlike the
  human vision which is psychophysical, light is a physical phenomenon. To
  measure light is straightforward. On a basic level, we measure how strong
  every wavelength is in the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by a light source,
  or one reflected from a regular object. We call this a
  <strong>spectral power distribution</strong>, or SPD in short. We usually only
  care about the wavelengths we can see, called the visible spectrum.

</p>

<p>
  The colors used in the examples above aren't accurate, but they're close.
  You'd need laser-like emitters with really narrow bands to produce pure
  wavelengths, but these color graphs are limited to what the average display
  device can produce, which is pretty limited in terms of purity.

<h2>Discrete SPDs</h2>
<p>
  It would be cool if we could store super detailed SPDs in our programs, but
  computer memory is limited, so we need to spare some bytes. The usual way to
  represent an SPD in memory is to use evenly spaced wavelengths. The visible
  spectrum ranges from 380 nanometers to 750 nanometers, so we could, for
  example, store the average light power in the [380, 390) nm range, then the
  average power in [390, 400) nm, and so on up to [740, 750) nm.
