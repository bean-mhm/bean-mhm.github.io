  Have you ever wondered how your computer draws different shapes and images
  tens of times a second? Ever wondered how video games render life-like scenes
  at 60 frames per second? Or, how your browser draws those rounded rectangles
  for the buttons, or how your operating system draws its windows?
</p>

<h2>The GPU</h2>
<p>
  You might already know that your computer needs a GPU, a graphics processing
  unit, to draw stuff onto the screen. But why's that the case? Well, there are
  several good reasons to do it that way. Firstly, your monitor needs some sort
  of input signal to display anything. Some use HDMI ports, older ones might use
  VGA, and so on. Now, these interfaces have different protocols that specify
  how the input signal should be encoded. So how do we send image data from our
  CPU to the display device? One idea might be to just write software for the
  CPU implementing a video protocol and somehow connecting the display device to
  the CPU. But, as it turns out, this method is really inefficient because the
  CPU needs to spend most of its time encoding the video signal, and this gets
  worse if there's only a single core, as was common in the early days.
</p>

<p>
  A better method is to use an entirely separate device to encode the video
  signal, such that the CPU sends raw image data to that device, and the device
  can freely spend all of its time encoding the video signal and sending it to
  the display device. Said device is what we call a graphics card. Note that
  it doesn't necessarily need to have fancy rendering functionality and ray
  tracing cores. Just taking raw pixel data and encoding them into a video
  signal is enough to be called a graphics card.
</p>

<p>
  This was the first reason to make graphics cards, but then, we quickly
  realized that we need a lot of parallelism to draw even simple 2D graphics.
  More specifically, we need to run the same instructions on all pixels at once,
  like a nested for loop:
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(height):
    for x in range(width):
    		pixels[y][x] = ...
</code></pre>

  This topic is really cool I want to talk about it all the time.
