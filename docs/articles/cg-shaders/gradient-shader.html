  Remember the <code>calculate_pixel_color()</code> function from
  <a href="$--prev_article_path--$" title="$--prev_article_title--$">the previous article</a>?
  Let's modify it so that it produces a blue-to-yellow gradient from left to
  right. Can you figure out how we can do this while only knowing the X and Y
  coordinates (and the width and height of the image)? Try to think about it for
  a bit, and come back when you're ready.
</p>
<h2>Linear Interpolation</h2>
<p>
  Ok, here's the spoiler. What we want is for the left-most pixels to have RGB
  values of <code>(0, 0, 1)</code> representing blue, and for the pixels at the
  right side to have <code>(1, 1, 0)</code>, representing yellow. For anything
  in between, we want to <em>linearly interpolate</em> between blue and yellow,
  so let's start from there and make a linear interpolation function, often
  called <code>mix()</code> or <code>lerp()</code> in graphics programming.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def mix(start, end, how_much):
  return start + how_much * (end - start)</code></pre>

<p>
  Try to fully understand how this works. If <code>how_much</code> is 0, the
  result will be <code>start + 0 * (end - start)</code>, which is just
  <code>start</code>. If it's 1, we'll get
  <code>start + 1 * (end - start)</code>, which is
  <code>start + end - start</code>, which simplifies to <code>end</code>. If
  <code>how_much</code> is 0.5, we get <code>start + 0.5 * (end - start)</code>,
  which is <code>start + (0.5 * end) - (0.5 * start)</code>, where
  <code>start</code> and <code>-(0.5 * start)</code> sum up to
  <code>0.5 * start</code> so we get <code>(0.5 * start) + (0.5 * end)</code>,
  which is <code>(start + end) / 2</code>. You might remember this as a method
  to take the middle point between two numbers. See how intuitive linear
  interpolation is?
</p>
<p>
  As a side note, people don't always use the same parameter names as we did,
  being <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>how_much</code>. One
  might use <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>t</code> for example.
  The third parameter is sometimes called the mix factor, or the blending
  factor.
</p>
<p>
  This is all well and good, but how do we turn our X and Y coordinates into a
  single mix factor from 0 to 1?
</p>
<h2>Range Mapping</h2>
<p>
  You might realize that we don't really need the Y coordinate, as we want a
  purely horizontal gradient where changing the Y coordinate has no effect on
  the values. What we want is to map our X coordinate from the (0, width) range
  to the (0, 1) range. An easy way to achieve this is to just divide X by the
  width of our image, which is 200 in our case. This gives us a value from 0 to
  1 that we can use as the mix factor. In the general case, we might need more
  arithmetic operations for range mapping. Imagine, for example, that we want to
  map a number, <code>v</code>, from the [4, 10] range to the [500, 700] range.
  For this, we need to calculate how much <code>v</code> has moved from 4 to 10.
  This is the exact opposite of linear interpolation. Instead of finding the
  interpolated value <code>v</code> given <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>,
  and <code>how_much</code>, we want to find <code>how_much</code> given
  <code>v</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>end</code>. This might sound
  complicated at first, but as we saw before, if <code>start</code> is 0
  (as it was in the (0, width) range), it becomes trivial to find
  <code>how_much</code>, as we just need to divide <code>v</code> by the size of
  our range. We could simply subtract <code>start</code> from both ends and
  transform our input range of [4, 10] to [0, 6] while it still has the same
  size of 6 units.
</p>
<p>
  We're almost done, we just need to subtract the same amount from
  <code>v</code> so that it stays just as far from <code>start</code> and
  <code>end</code> as it was before. We can now simply divide <code>v</code>
  by 6 (the size of our range) to find <code>how_much</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># returns t (the mix factor)
def unmix(v, start, end):
    return (v - start) / (end - start)</code></pre>

<p>
  After this <em>unmixing</em>, we can now <em>remix</em> in the output range,
  [500, 700].
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def remap(
  v,
  input_start,
  input_end,
  output_start,
  output_end
):
    how_much = unmix(v, input_start, input_end)
    return mix(output_start, output_end, how_much)</code></pre>

<p>
  If we use the actual math operations instead of calling <code>unmix()</code>
  and <code>mix()</code>, we get the following.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def remap(
  v,
  input_start,
  input_end,
  output_start,
  output_end
):
    t = (v - input_start) / (input_end - input_start)
    return output_start + t * (output_end - output_start)</code></pre>

<p>
  This function basically figures out how much <code>v</code> has moved relative
  to the input range, and moves it by the same amount in the output range.
</p>
<h2><code>mix()</code> for RGB?</h2>
<p>
  So far, we know how to mix between single numbers, but our original goal was
  to mix between two RGB triplets, namely, blue and yellow. Conveniently for us,
  we can just do the same mix operation for all three color channels (RGB)
  individually and effectively lerp between the two colors.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def mix_colors(
  a: Color,
  b: Color,
  t: float
) -> Color:
    result = new Color(
      red=mix(a.red, b.red, t),
      green=mix(a.green, b.green, t),
      blue=mix(a.blue, b.blue, t)
    )</code></pre>

<p>
  We're finally ready to update our <code>calculate_pixel_color()</code>
  function to give us a blue-to-yellow gradient from left to right.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def calculate_pixel_color(x: int, y: int) -> Color:
  blue = new Color(0, 0, 1)
  yellow = new Color(1, 1, 0)
  t = x / width
  return mix_colors(blue, yellow, t)</code></pre>

<p>
  Keep in mind that, unlike <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> which vary for
  every pixel, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are global constants
  and have the same value for all pixels. We call these uniform values, or just
  uniforms, as they don't change throughout the shading process.
</p>

<p>
  I've gone ahead and implemented this shader in GLSL, the OpenGL Shading
  Language. Here's what it looks like.
