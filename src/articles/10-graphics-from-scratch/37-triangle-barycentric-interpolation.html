  In the last few articles, we manually rendered triangles using nothing but
  math, and we exported the final image to a PNG file. Here's what we had at the
  end:
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/cpu-2-triangles.png"
  alt="a blue triangle and a pink triangle on top of it" title="a blue triangle and a pink triangle on top of it"
  style="width: 28rem;" />

<p>
  This is great, but wouldn't it be cool if we could have different colors for
  each vertex, and blend between them? Not just color, but anything else, like
  normal vectors, positions, or texture coordinates! Yes, we're getting closer
  to texturing, so be excited.
</p>
<p>
  Let's modify our <code>Triangle</code> class to store different colors for
  every vertex.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Triangle:
    v0: Vec2
    v1: Vec2
    v2: Vec2
    v0_col: Color
    v1_col: Color
    v2_col: Color

    def __init__(
        self,
        v0: Vec2,
        v1: Vec2,
        v2: Vec2,
        v0_col: Color,
        v1_col: Color,
        v2_col: Color
    ) -> None:
        self.v0 = v0
        self.v1 = v1
        self.v2 = v2
        self.v0_col = v0_col
        self.v1_col = v1_col
        self.v2_col = v2_col

    ...</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Let's update the triangle list to account for the changes we just made. We'll
  also get rid of the second triangle to keep things simple for now.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># triangle list
tris: list[Triangle] = []
tris.append(Triangle(
    v0=Vec2(256, 48),
    v1=Vec2(160, 192),
    v2=Vec2(64, 48),
    v0_col=Color(1, .2, .1),
    v1_col=Color(.2, 1, .1),
    v2_col=Color(.1, .2, 1)
))</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Now, we need to update the render code to somehow interpolate the color. We'll
  also remove some redundant comments.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        p = Vec2(x + .5, y + .5)

        col = Color(.1, .1, .1)
        for tri in tris:
            bary: Vec3 = tri.cart_to_bary(p)
            if bary_is_outside(bary):
                continue

            # TODO: interpolate the color

        idx = icoord_to_idx(x, HEIGHT - y - 1, WIDTH)
        buf[idx] = col</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>It's Barycentric, Again</h2>
<p>
  It turns out we have everything we need for interpolating values between the
  vertices of a triangle. If <code>b0</code>, <code>b1</code>, and
  <code>b2</code> are our Barycentric coordinates, and <code>a</code>,
  <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are the data on the vertices, we can blend
  between them by scaling each data value by its corresponding Barycentric
  coordinate, and adding them up:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>interpolated = (b0 * a) + (b1 * b) + (b2 * c)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  This makes sense, because if <code>b0</code> is 1, then we know that
  <code>p</code> is exactly on <code>v0</code>. If <code>b1</code> is 1, then
  <code>p</code> is on <code>v1</code>, and so on. If <code>p</code> is at the
  center of the triangle, the three smaller triangles we get by drawing line
  segments from each vertex to <code>p</code>, occupy the same proportion of
  area in relation to the larger triangle, and since they add up to 1, we get
  (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) as our Barycentric coordinates, meaning the three data values
  will be averaged out.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to keep in mind that <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and
  <code>c</code> can be either scalars or vectors of any dimension, but
  <code>b0</code>, <code>b1</code>, and <code>b2</code> are always scalars.
  Though, when combined, they make a 3D vector, but I digress. What this means
  is that we can blend colors, positions, single scalar numbers, or anything we
  want. In this case, we want to blend colors.
</p>

<p>
  Back in the render code, we'll update the loop that goes through the triangle
  list.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for y in range(HEIGHT):
    for x in range(WIDTH):
        ...

        for tri in tris:
            bary: Vec3 = tri.cart_to_bary(p)
            if bary_is_outside(bary):
                continue

            col = (Vec3.scalar(bary.x) * tri.v0_col) \
                + (Vec3.scalar(bary.y) * tri.v1_col) \
                + (Vec3.scalar(bary.z) * tri.v2_col)

        ...</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>RGB Triplets Are Vectors in Disguise</h2>

<p>
  Did you see it? There's a huge problem with the code above. We're trying to
  multiply a <code>Vec3</code> by a <code>Color</code>, which is an entirely
  separate class. We've talked about how we can treat RGB triplets as 3D
  vectors, and how it's easier to not have separate classes for structures that
  can be represented as vectors. Let's get rid of the <code>Color</code> class
  entirely, and use <code>Vec3</code> instead. You can use the "find and
  replace" feature of your code editor to replace any occurance of
  <code>Color</code> with <code>Vec3</code>. Make sure it's case sensitive. If
  you're using VS Code, you need to enable the "Match Case" option. We're almost
  there. In the loop where we fill the RGB8 buffer, we need to use
  <code>col.x/y/z</code> instead of <code>col.r/g/b</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># RGB8 buffer
buf_rgb8: list[tuple[int, int, int]] = []
for i in range(N_PIXELS):
    col: Vec3 = buf[i]
    buf_rgb8.append((
        int(col.x * 255),
        int(col.y * 255),
        int(col.z * 255)
    ))</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  And, we're done! If we rerun the script, this is what we'll get:

  title="a colorful triangle with different colors on each vertex" style="width: 28rem;" />

  In the next article, we'll render a texture onto a

  of two triangles.
