  Up until now, we've been ignoring our pixels' center coordinates. In the
  gradient shader, we divided X by the width of our image to get a value from 0
  to 1 in the horizontal direction, but is that really correct? Consider this
  4x4 grid of pixels with their X and Y indices labeled in red, starting from
  zero.

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/4x4grid.png" alt="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with their indices labeled"
  title="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with their indices labeled" style="width: 22rem;" />

<p>
  Take, for example, the first pixel from the bottom left. Where does the point
  (0, 0) actually fall in the continuous 2D plane? Is it on one of the corners
  of the pixel? Is it on the center?
</p>

<p>
  Here's an idea. We know that our image occupies 4 units of space in each
  direction, so why not put a ruler for each axis to help us measure our pixels?
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/4x4grid-ruler.png"
  alt="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with two rulers for the X and Y axes"
  title="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with two rulers for the X and Y axes" style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  Ah! It's starting to make sense. If we plot the integer coordinates of a
  pixel as a point on the 2D plane, we get the bottom left corner of the pixel.
  This means that the center of the pixel must be offset by 0.5 units.
</p>
<p>
  Treating the pixel grid coordinates like this will also make our calculations
  a lot easier and more intuitive. For example, to find the pixel that's 20%
  of the way along the width of the image and 70% along the height, we just need
  to multiply our width and height by 0.2 and 0.7 respectively.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">(4, 4) * (0.2, 0.7) = (0.8, 2.8)</code></pre>

<p>
  The resulting point doesn't represent an exact pixel on our grid, and that's
  totally fine! In image sampling, for example, we use methods like bilinear
  interpolation (which is just a 2D version of linear interpolation) to mix the
  colors from the 4 closest pixels to our sample point, giving them different
  weights based on how close they each are to the sample point. If you need to
  know the exact integer coordinates of the pixel that contains this point, all
  you need to know is to <em>floor</em> (round down) your coordinates, so for
  our example above, we get:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">floor(0.8, 2.8) = (0, 2)</code></pre>

<p>
  In fact, let's actually plot the (unfloored) point on our grid to confirm
  this.
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/4x4grid-point.png" alt="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with a point plotted"
  title="a 4 by 4 grid of pixels with a point plotted" style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  This might seem trivial, but it's a super important concept to grasp and will
  come in handy later.

  using a GPU.
