  As we saw in
  <a href="$--prev_article_path--$" title="$--prev_article_title--$">the previous article</a>,
  we need to use Barycentric coordinates if we want to know whether a point is
  inside a certain triangle. Barycentric coordinates consist of three numbers
  representing how close a given point is to the 3 vertices of a triangle, and
  whether the point is inside the triangle.
</p>

<h2>Relative to a Specific Triangle</h2>
<p>
  Unlike the Caretsian coordinate system, which is what we've been using so far,
  Barycentric coordinate systems are specific to a triangle. When we talk about
  Barycentric coordinates, we need to mention what triangle they belong to.
  There is no global Barycentric coordinate system, and every triangle has its
  own Barycentric coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a random triangle with its vertices labeled <code>v0</code>,
  <code>v1</code>, and <code>v2</code>.
</p>

  alt="a triangle with its vertices labeled v0, v1, and v2" title="a triangle with its vertices labeled v0, v1, and v2"
  style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  If we place a point <code>p</code> exactly on <code>v0</code>, the Barycentric
  coordinates of that point relative to this triangle would be (1, 0, 0). If we
  move it to <code>v1</code>, we get (0, 1, 0), and if we move it to
  <code>v2</code>, we get (0, 0, 1). For anywhere else, the values get linearly
  interpolated.
</p>

<h2>The Formula</h2>
<p>
  To compute the Barycentric coordinates of a point <code>p</code> relative to a
  triangle with vertices <code>v0</code>, <code>v1</code>, and <code>v2</code>,
  we first draw line segments from the 3 vertices to <code>p</code>. This
  creates three new triangles, namely, <code>v0-p-v1</code>,
</p>

  alt="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v0-p-v1"
  title="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v0-p-v1" style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  <code>v0-p-v2</code>,
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/triangle-v0pv2.png"
  alt="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v0-p-v2"
  title="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v0-p-v2" style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  and <code>v1-p-v2</code>.
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/triangle-v1pv2.png"
  alt="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v1-p-v2"
  title="a triangle and a point inside it with an inner triangle v1-p-v2" style="width: 30rem;" />

<p>
  We'll name the Barycentric coordinates <code>b0</code>, <code>b1</code>, and
  <code>b2</code>. To compute <code>b0</code>, we calculate the area of the
  <code>v1-p-v2</code> triangle, shaded blue, and divide it by the area of the
  big triangle. Note how this triangle is in front of <code>v0</code>, and that
  we use the other two vertices instead of <code>v0</code>. When <code>p</code>
  is exactly on <code>v0</code>, the <code>v1-p-v2</code> triangle fills up all
  of the larger triangle, while the other smaller triangles collapse to nothing,
  which explains why we get (1, 0, 0) as our Barycentric coordinates. Similarly,
  <code>b1</code> is equal to the area of <code>v0-p-v2</code>, shaded orange,
  divided by the total area. You should be able to guess what <code>b2</code>
  is equal to at this point.
</p>

<p>
  So, all we really need to do is to calculate some triangle areas. Neat!
  Or...?!
</p>

<h2>Triangle Area</h2>
<p>
  There are multiple formulas for the area of a triangle, but the one we'll use
  is equal to one half times the length of a side, times the length of another
  side, times the sine of the angle between the two sides. This might sound
  complicated to implement, but thanks to mathematicians, there is a really
  simple formula that does 90% of what we need without using (co)sine functions
  or square roots! This function takes two 2D vectors as its input and returns
  the product of their lengths and the sine of the angle between them. It
  just lacks the final multiplication by (1/2), which is why I said it does 90%
  of what we need. We'll skip over the details of this function and how it's
  derived.
</p>

<p>
  Insert the following piece of code before the code section. To recap, we have
  constants first, then classes, then functions, and finally the code section.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># |a| * |b| * sin(theta)
def cross_2d(a: Vec2, b: Vec2) -> float:
    return (a.x * b.y) - (a.y * b.x)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  This function has another property: it tells us whether the vertices are
  ordered clockwise or counterclockwise, such that we'll get a negative output
  if they're ordered clockwise. This actually plays a major role in detecting
  whether <code>p</code> is inside the triangle, but it means we need to go back
  to the code section and reorder our vertices so that they're in a
  counterclockwise order.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># triangle vertices
v0 = Vec2(256, 48)
v1 = Vec2(160, 192)
v2 = Vec2(64, 48)</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Quick Detour</h2>
<p>
  We're almost there, but first, we need a <code>Vec3</code> class to represent
  Barycentric coordinates. Of course, we'll use it for other things later.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Vec3:
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, z: float) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    @staticmethod
    def scalar(s: float):
        return Vec3(s, s, s)

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vec3(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y, self.z + other.z)

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        self.x += other.x
        self.y += other.y
        self.z += other.z

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Vec3(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y, self.z - other.z)

    def __isub__(self, other):
        self.x -= other.x
        self.y -= other.y
        self.z -= other.z

    def __mul__(self, other):
        return Vec3(self.x * other.x, self.y * other.y, self.z * other.z)

    def __imul__(self, other):
        self.x *= other.x
        self.y *= other.y
        self.z *= other.z

    def __truediv__(self, other):
        return Vec3(self.x / other.x, self.y / other.y, self.z / other.z)

    def __idiv__(self, other):
        self.x /= other.x
        self.y /= other.y
        self.z /= other.z

    def __neg__(self):
        return Vec3(-self.x, -self.y, -self.z)</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Caretsian to Barycentric</h2>
<p>
  Let's now create a function that computes the Barycentric coordinates of a
  point <code>p</code> with respect to a triangle with vertices <code>v0</code>,
  <code>v1</code>, and <code>v2</code>. Add this piece of code below
  the <code>cross_2d()</code> function.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># triangle vertices must be ordered counterclockwise
def cart_to_bary(
    p: Vec2,
    v0: Vec2,
    v1: Vec2,
    v2: Vec2
) -> Vec3:
    b = Vec3(
        cross_2d(v1 - p, v2 - p),
        cross_2d(v2 - p, v0 - p),
        cross_2d(v0 - p, v1 - p)
    )
    b /= Vec3.scalar(cross_2d(v1 - v0, v2 - v0))
    return b</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  We're not using the (1/2) factor, since it gets canceled out because it also
  applies to the denominator which is the total area.
</p>

<p>
  An interesting property of Barycentric coordinates is that they always add up
  to up, and this makes sense, because the smaller triangles perfectly divide
  the larger triangle into three pieces.
</p>

<p>
  The last step is to figure out whether <code>p</code> is inside the triangle.
  Remember the three smaller triangles we made by drawing line segments from
  every vertex to <code>p</code>? Well, one or more of those triangles turn out
  to be ordered clockwise when <code>p</code> is outside the triangle, which
  means we get negative values in our Barycentric coordinates, and that's how we
  decide if <code>p</code> is inside or outside the triangle!
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def bary_is_outside(b: Vec3) -> bool:
    return min(b.x, b.y, b.z) < 0</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>The Rendering</h2>
<p>
  We are now ready to determine which pixels fall inside the triangle, and color
  them differently than the ones that don't. We'll do this and more in the next
  article.
