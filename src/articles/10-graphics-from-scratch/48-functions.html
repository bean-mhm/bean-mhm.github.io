  You might have heard that functions are like mathematical devices that take
  something as input and spit out something else based on the input. Here's a
  very simple function:
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/function-device.png"
  alt="a square labeled f representing a function with x as the input and x+1 as the output"
  title="a square labeled f representing a function with x as the input and x+1 as the output" style="width: 24rem;" />

<p>
  This function takes in a number as input and returns one plus that number. A
  function can technically ignore its input and always return a constant value.
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/function-constant.png"
  alt="a function that ignores its input and always returns the same constant value"
  title="a function that ignores its input and always returns the same constant value" style="width: 24rem;" />

<p>
  Some functions take more than one input and mix them in different ways.
</p>

<img src="$--root_path--$/assets/images/articles/function-2d.png"
  alt="a function that takes in two inputs (x and y) and returns x - y"
  title="a function that takes in two inputs (x and y) and returns x - y" style="width: 24rem;" />

<p>
  The number of inputs that a function takes is its dimensionality. The above is
  a two-dimensional function because it takes two variables as input.
</p>

<p>
  Functions can also take vectors as inputs and return vectors as their output,
  and they don't need to have the same dimensionality. Here's a function that
  takes in a single number and returns a 2D vector:
</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
  Here's the definition of a function copied straight from Wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote>
  In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of
  X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and
  the set Y is called the codomain of the function.
</blockquote>

<p>
  A function basically draws an arrow between the elements in the input set (the
  domain of the function) to the elements in the set of all possible outputs,
  called the range of the function. These sets can be infinitely large, like the
  set of all real numbers.
</p>

<h2>Pure Functions</h2>

<p>
  There is a major difference between functions in mathematics and functions
  in programming. Functions in programming can (but don't have to) read from and
  write to external variables called the state, but functions in mathematics can
  only ever give an output based on their input and nothing else. These are
  called pure functions. If you keep giving the same input to a pure function,
  you'll always get the same output, but this isn't the case for functions in
  programming languages.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a pure function in Python:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def some_function(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  And an impure one:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code># global variable outside the function (state)
counter: int = 0

def some_function(a: int) -> int:
      global counter

      # write to external variable (state)
      counter += 1

      # file input/output (state)
      counter_file.write(counter)

      # read from external variable
      return counter + a</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Visualizing Functions</h2>
<p>
  People have come up with different ways for visualizing functions of different
  dimensions and types, the simplest of which being 1D functions which take a
  single variable as input and spit out a single number. As you already know,
  the common way to visualize 1D functions is to graph them. Below is a
  basic sinusoidal function and its graph in
  <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">Desmos</a>, a
  popular online graphing calculator.
</p>

<p>
  Things get a bit complicated when we go 2D. First of all, there are many
  different "types" of functions. Some 2D functions take in a 2D vector
  representing a point on the 2D plane and output another 2D vector representing
  some quantity at that point, like the electric field. These are called vector
  fields because they return a vector for every point in space. A common way to
  visualize them is to use arrows on a grid of points.
</p>

  alt="visualization of a 2D vector field with arrows on a grid of points"
  title="visualization of a 2D vector field with arrows on a grid of points" style="width: 36rem;" />

<p>
  Some 2D functions output a single number (a scalar) for every point. These
  are often visualized with 3D surfaces where the height (Z) is equal to the
  output of the function at that point (X and Y).
</p>

  alt="a 2D function that outputs a scalar for every point visualized with a 3D surface"
  title="a 2D function that outputs a scalar for every point visualized with a 3D surface" style="width: 36rem;" />

<p>
  We can actually treat our renderer as a function too! It takes the coordinates
  of a pixel as input and outputs an RGB color triplet represented as a 3D
  vector. To prove this, I and my friend have made a fully functional (as in,
  using pure functions)

<p>
  Texture samplers are another example of 2D functions that map 2D points to RGB
  triplets. Samplers with different wrap modes can be thought of as different 2D
  functions. Although, technically, we <em>can</em> have 1D or even 3D textures,
  but we'll stick to working with 2D textures for now.
</p>

<p>
  This article was meant to be a quick reminder on functions and how we can
  treat renderers, shaders, or texture samplers as functions. In the next one,
  we'll explore interesting effects that can be achieved by manipulating our
  sample point, AKA the input we give to the sampler.
