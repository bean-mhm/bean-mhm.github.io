      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a guy who is fascinated by computers and graphics. I love how you
        can use shaders and a bit of math knowledge to produce great looking
        images that might look like real photos. I find it amazing how you can
        combine logic gates to build a device capable of executing any given
        series of instructions. I like how we can simulate interesting physical
        phenomena with a bit of coding.

        I made this blog to share the tiny amount of knowledge I've learned, and
        different projects that I work on. I might post about various other
        topics at times.

        something new here!
